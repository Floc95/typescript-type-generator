# Typescript type generator

## Description
Typescript type generator is a little tool to easily convert C# classes to Typescript interfaces online, without the need to install any tool or package to your projects.
There is no big library behind this converter, it's all handmade to be the most simplified version of it. 

There is no backend API, everything is done in the frontend. The files you upload are only read by your browser and they are not sent anywhere. This way you can use it in your company without any risk of leaks. But if you feel more confortable this way, you can clone this projet and run it locally on your computer.

If you have a bug or if the converter doesn't handle your case, please add an issue to this project.
